# Cotton Leaf Disease Detection and Prediction
 
This project harnesses the power of machine learning to detect and predict diseases on cotton leaves. 
After meticulously training our model on a comprehensive dataset, we rigorously tested its accuracy and reliability. 
To make this innovative solution accessible, we've deployed it as a user-friendly web application using Flask.

Technologies- Python, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, Flask.

This project was done in a Group as a Project Evaluation for the UG Program.
